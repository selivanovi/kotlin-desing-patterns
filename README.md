way to solve common problems and improve the overall quality, maintainability, and flexibility of software systems.

## Creational Patterns

Creational patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner
suitable to the situation.

## Structural Patterns

Structural patterns are design patterns that ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships
between entities.

## Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral patterns are design patterns that identify common communication patterns between objects and realize these
patterns.
